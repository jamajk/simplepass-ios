A simple iOS app for creating and storing passwords, created mostly for my own use and learning purposes.

Right now it supports only iPhones.
Original app icon (key shape) taken from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik" title="Freepik">Freepik</a> at <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon"> www.flaticon.com</a> and edited by me.

The app uses the KeychainAccess wrapper by user <a href="https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi" title="kishikawakatsumi">kishikawakatsumi</a> on GitHub. It's a very useful tool.

A more elaborate description coming soon
